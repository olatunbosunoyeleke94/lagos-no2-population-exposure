# Mapping NO₂ and Population Exposure in Lagos

This project explores the relationship between nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) air pollution and population distribution in Lagos, Nigeria, using satellite remote sensing and geospatial data analysis in Python.

**City:** Lagos, Nigeria  
**Tools:** Google Earth Engine, Sentinel-5P, WorldPop, ESA WorldCover  
**Tech Stack:** Python, Earth Engine, geemap, pandas, matplotlib

## Project Overview

Using publicly available datasets, this analysis investigates:

- Where NO₂ pollution is most concentrated in Lagos  
- Which population groups are most exposed  
- How land cover types influence exposure levels  

The goal is to support environmental awareness, public health planning, and urban resilience efforts in fast-growing African cities.
